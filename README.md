In this project, I conduct a statistical A/B test in the field of Facebook advertising to compare the effectiveness of two bidding strategies: Maximum Bidding and Average Bidding. The dataset available on Kaggle titled [Optimizing Ad Bidding: Facebook's A/B Test Story](https://kaggle.com/datasets/furth3r/facebook-ab-test-of-bidding-feature)

The A/B test focuses on evaluating how these two bidding strategies perform. The control group uses maximum bidding, a manual fixed bid approach, while the test group utilizes average bidding, an automated method adapting bids in real-time. The goal is to determine which strategy delivers better results for advertisers
